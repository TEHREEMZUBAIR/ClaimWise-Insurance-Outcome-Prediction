# 🚗🔍 **ClaimWise: Predicting Insurance Outcomes with AI** 🚗🔍

## 📝 **Project Description**

**ClaimWise** is a machine learning project designed to predict whether an insurance customer will file a claim based on customer demographics, vehicle characteristics, and driving history. By building intelligent models, the project helps insurance companies assess risks more accurately, optimize premium pricing, and improve decision-making.

✨ **Key Features**:
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Discovering patterns and relationships.
- 🤖 **Model Building**: Implementing models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
- 🧠 **Neural Network**: Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for enhanced prediction.
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Using metrics like confusion matrices, error curves, and classification reports.

## 📂 **Dataset Overview**

The dataset consists of customer and vehicle-related features, helping predict the likelihood of a claim being filed. Important columns include:

- 👤 **Customer Age**: Customer's age.
- 🚗 **Vehicle Ownership**: Does the customer own the vehicle?
- 🚓 **Speeding Violations**: Number of speeding violations.
- 🍸 **DUIs**: Incidents of driving under the influence.
- 💥 **Past Accidents**: Number of past accidents.
- 🎯 **Outcome**: Claim filed (1) or not filed (0).
